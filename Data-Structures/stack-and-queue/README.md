# Stacks and Queues
* Stack: First in last out

* Queue: First in first out

## Challenge
to declare a class stack and class queue and write some function  inside it and write some tests to test our code

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

## API
* Stack:
  1. Pop: its return the top of the stack and delete it from the stack
  2. Push: its add a new node to the top of the stack
  3. peek: its return the top of the stack without delete the node
  4. isEmpty: its a function to return True of the stack is empty and False if not

* Queue: 
  1. Enqueue: its add a new node to the rear of the Queue
  2. Dequeue: its return the node which is in the front of the queue and delete it
  3. peek: its return the node which is in the front of the queue without delete it
  4. isEmpty: its a function to return True of the queue is empty and False if not
